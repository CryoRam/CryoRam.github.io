                    <p>
                        We are a small company whose primary goal is to make webpages. While 
                        our team may be small we still try to work on every commsion when 
                        possible. We aim to make webpages according to specifications that 
                        are given to us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our origin comes from a web development course assignment. We were founded 
                        in Utah and operate from there also.

                    <h3>Orders</h3>
                    <p>
                        When filing out an order form please put your name and e-mail address 
                        in the form along with your phone number if you want to. This will send 
                        us a notification that you are interested in commisioning us. It will 
                        also provide us a way to contact you back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you send in the order form please be patient. Since our team is 
                        small we may not be able to immediately get to you. We will however try 
                        to get to your request in a timely manner.

                    <h3>Commisions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once we get in contact with you you may give us the details on the 
                        commision. We will then take your commision into consideration. If 
                        your commision is rejected we will let you know about the rejection 
                        immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However if your commision is accepted we will contact you again. During 
                        this contact we will ask for specifics for the webpage or webpages. After 
                        we will then discuss pricing as seen on the commisions page. This payment 
                        will be payed out in advance.
